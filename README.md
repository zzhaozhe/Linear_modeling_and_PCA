However, it is common that there is still implicit difference in treating employees with different backgrounds and personalities. The purpose of this Data analysis report is to help Pacific Northwest Company to determine if there is any different treatment based on gender and race, and to examine what personality would the company prefer when evaluating the performance of employees and deciding who is to promote. This report finds that gender and race difference in job rating and odds of getting promoted still exists. The company would favor consistency and creativity in employees’ personalities.
